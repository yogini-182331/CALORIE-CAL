# CALORIE-CAL

As a member of team of the topic Calorie calculator project, my primary contribution was designing and implementing the methodology that forms the backbone of the program. The goal was to create a reliable and efficient system to estimate daily caloric needs based on user input and scientific formulas.
Researched and implemented the Harris-Benedict Equation and Mifflin-St Jeror formula for calculating Basal Metabolic Rate(BMR), which serves as the foundation for the calorie calculator. Designed the program logic to account for factors such as age, weight, height and activity levels. 
Ensure the methodology aligns with standard nutritional guidenlines and best practices.
 Created a robust function in C to calculate caloric requirements dynamically based on input parameters.
Implemented an different activity multiplier to adjust BMR calculations for different activity levels (eg: sedentary, moderate, active).
Debugged and optimized the program to ensure accuracy and efficiency in calculations.
I worked closely with the development team to integrate the methodology into the main program and tested it rigorously to validate results.

One of the main challenges was ensure the program could handle edge cases, such as invalid or extreme input values. I addressed this incorporating input validation checks and error-handling mechanisms.
Through my efforts, the calorie calculator methodology was established as a reliable tool for estimating caloric needs. This experience allowed me to enhance my skills in algorithm designs, research, and practical application of scientific concepts in programming
